        General Tso's chicken (pronounced [tswoÌ€]) is a sweet, piquant, deep-fried chicken dish that is served in North American Chinese restaurants. (It is also seen with other variants, such as General Tse's chicken or General Gau's chicken.) The dish is named after Zuo Zongtang (formerly romanized Tso Tsung-t'ang), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader, although there is no recorded connection to him nor is the dish known in Hunan, Zuo's home province.

            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Place sauce ingredients in a quart jar with a lid and shake to mix. If you make this ahead of time just refrigerate until needed, shaking it again when you are ready to use it. This also keeps your dirty dishes down.</p>

            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>Mix cornstarch slurry in a large bowl- the mixture will be strange but trust me it works. It will be VERY thick almost paste like. Add ALL the chicken pieces and stir to coat. Using a fork remove ONE chicken piece at a time and let the excess mixture drip off. YES even though the mixture has a weird consistency it will not stick like paste and the excess will drip off.</p>

            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Add chicken to the hot (350 degree) oil and fry until crispy. Only cook 7 or 8 chicken pieces at a time. You do not want to lower the temp of the oil by cooking too many at a time. You can use a simple cooking or candy thermometer to judge the temp of the oil.</p>

            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>Add chicken to sauce in wok and heat just until the chicken is hot enough for you. It may not even need a minute if you kept the chicken warm. The quicker you serve it the crispier the chicken stays.</p>
